# Life-Expectancy-Data-Analysis
Project Overview:
Life expectancy serves as a vital indicator of a population's health and well-being. Analyzing life expectancy data helps uncover the factors that influence health outcomes across various countries, regions, and time periods. This project seeks to investigate trends in life expectancy, identify key drivers, and gain insights into health inequalities.

Data Source:
  Example: Life Expectancy Analysis.csv

Objectives:
1. Analyze trends: Explore global and regional life expectancy trends over time.
2.Identify key factors: Examine the impact of socioeconomic, environmental, and healthcare-related factors on life expectancy.
3. Predictive modeling: Develop predictive models to forecast future life expectancy based on various factors.
4. Comparison: Compare life expectancy across countries and regions to identify inequalities and correlations with development indicators.

Data Preparation:
1.	Data Collection:
Gather life expectancy data and related variables (GDP, healthcare, education) from reliable sources like WHO or World Bank.
2.	Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values through imputation or removal.
Remove duplicates and check for outliers that could skew results.
3.	Data Transformation:
Normalize/standardize variables like GDP to ensure comparability.
Convert categorical variables (e.g., country, region) into numerical format using encoding.

How to use:
1.	Open the Power BI report file: 
	Load the Power BI file that contains the life expectancy analysis dashboard.
2.	Explore the dashboard components:
	Interact with visualizations like life expectancy trends, comparisons between countries, and key influencing factors.
•	Look at different charts and graphs to understand the health patterns over time and across regions.
3.	Use filters and slicers: 
	Apply filters (such as country, year, or region) to focus on specific segments of the data.
•	Use slicers to compare life expectancy by BMI, healthcare expenditure, or other relevant factors.
4.	Export data or create custom reports:
	If needed, export the data shown in the visualizations for further analysis.
•	Create custom reports based on your specific requirements (e.g., focus on certain countries, regions).

Challenges:
1.	Data Completeness and Availability:
Life expectancy data may be incomplete or missing for certain countries or years, making it difficult to maintain consistency in analysis.
2.	Data Quality and Reliability:
Variations in data collection methods across countries can lead to inconsistencies, affecting the reliability of the analysis.
3.	Geopolitical and External Factors:
Events like wars, pandemics, and natural disasters can drastically affect life expectancy and are hard to model accurately.

Conclusion: 
• Life Expectancy Analysis helps us to understand the various factors responsible for death rates.

•	This allows Countries or regions to determine the predicting factor, impacting on life expectancy.

•	This project enables us to decrease the mortality of the country by making the changes to the healthcare system & other development in the society.

•	It will also useful in helping the countries or regions to determine which area should be priorities to increase the Life expectancy.
